《毕业生》的主题曲《Scarborough Fair》的中文翻译，牛啊。  
  
问尔所之，是否如适 Are you going to Scarborough Fair  
蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme  
彼方淑女，凭君寄辞 Remember me to one who lives there  
伊人曾在，与我相知 She once was a true love of mine  
嘱彼佳人，备我衣缁 Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme  
勿用针剪，无隙无疵 Without no seams nor needle work  
伊人何在，慰我相思 Then she will be a true love of mine  
伴唱：  
彼山之阴，深林荒址 On the side of hill in the deep forest green  
冬寻毡毯，老雀燕子 Tracing of sparrow on snow crested brown  
雪覆四野，高山迟滞 Blankets and bed clothers the child of maintain  
眠而不觉，寒笳清嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call  
嘱彼佳人，营我家室 Tell her to find me an acre of land  
蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme  
良田所修，大海之坻 Between the salt water and the sea strand  
伊人应在，任我相视 Then she will be a true love of mine  
伴唱：  
彼山之阴，叶疏苔蚀 On the side of hill a sprinkling of leaves  
涤彼孤冢，珠泪渐渍 Washes the grave with slivery tears  
昔我长剑，日日拂拭 A soldier cleans and polishes a gun  
寂而不觉，寒笳长嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call  
嘱彼佳人，收我秋实 Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather  
蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme  
敛之集之，勿弃勿失 And gather it all in a bunch of heather  
伊人犹在，唯我相誓 Then she will be a ture love of mine  
伴唱：  
烽火印啸，浴血之师 War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions  
将帅有令，勤王之事 Generals order their soldiers to kill and to fight for a cause  
争斗缘何，久忘其旨 They have long ago forgoten  
痴而不觉，寒笳悲嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
